# Multi-Layer Personality Extraction Guide for AI Agents

## Overview
This systematic approach extracts dual-layer personality profiles (public persona vs. behavioral reality) for creating sophisticated AI agents capable of realistic negotiation and decision-making.

## **Step 1: Choose Your Public Figure**
Select a well-documented figure where you can analyze rhetoric vs. reality gaps (politicians, CEOs, historical leaders).

---

## **Step 2A: Public Persona OCEAN Analysis**

### Copy-Paste Prompt:
```
Analyze [FIGURE NAME]'s PUBLIC personality using Big Five (OCEAN):

For each dimension, provide:
- Score 1-10 based on his PUBLIC STATEMENTS and rhetoric
- Examples from speeches, interviews, official communications
- How he PRESENTS himself in high-pressure situations

OCEAN Dimensions:
- Openness to Experience
- Conscientiousness
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism

Focus on: What personality does he PROJECT to the world?
Format as structured analysis with clear scores and evidence.
```

## **Step 2B: Behavioral Reality OCEAN Analysis**

### Copy-Paste Prompt:
```
Analyze [FIGURE NAME]'s ACTUAL personality using Big Five (OCEAN):

For each dimension, provide:
- Score 1-10 based on his DOCUMENTED ACTIONS and decisions
- Examples from policy decisions, crisis responses, strategic moves
- How he ACTUALLY behaves when stakes are high

OCEAN Dimensions:
- Openness to Experience
- Conscientiousness
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism

Focus on: What personality do his ACTIONS reveal?
Format as structured analysis with clear scores and evidence.
```

## **Step 3: Communication Patterns Analysis**

### Copy-Paste Prompt:
```
Analyze [FIGURE NAME]'s communication across contexts:

PUBLIC COMMUNICATION:
- Phrases for international audiences
- Diplomatic language patterns
- Official justifications and reasoning
- Formality levels by context

STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION:
- What messages does he send through actions?
- How do his behaviors contradict his words?
- What does he communicate without saying?
- Body language and non-verbal patterns

Extract: 
- 10-15 characteristic phrases he commonly uses
- 5-8 behavioral patterns that contradict his words
- Communication style differences by audience/context
```

**Save as:** `[name]_communication.txt`

## **Step 4: Negotiation & Decision-Making Behavior**

### Copy-Paste Prompt:
```
Analyze [FIGURE NAME]'s negotiation patterns across TWO layers:

PUBLIC NEGOTIATION STYLE:
1. What does he SAY about his approach to negotiations?
2. How does he frame his positions publicly?
3. What image does he project during diplomatic events?

ACTUAL NEGOTIATION BEHAVIOR:
1. Opening Strategy: How does he start negotiations?
2. Concession Patterns: Does he concede quickly or hold firm?
3. Pressure Response: How does he react when cornered?
4. Information Tactics: How does he use/withhold information?
5. Relationship Building: Does he prioritize rapport or results?
6. Risk Taking: Conservative or aggressive in uncertain situations?

Compare and contrast: Where do words and actions diverge?
Provide specific examples from documented negotiations and conflicts.
```

**Save as:** `[name]_negotiation.txt`

## **Step 5: Crisis Response & Advanced Behavioral Patterns**

### Copy-Paste Prompt:
```
Analyze [FIGURE NAME]'s crisis response and advanced behavioral patterns:

1. CRISIS-LATENCY PATTERNS:
   - How long does he typically stay silent during major crises?
   - What does he do during these "silence windows"?
   - Examples from major crisis situations

2. SCAPEGOATING PATTERNS:
   - Who gets blamed after failures or setbacks?
   - How does he deflect responsibility?
   - Pattern of official "resignations" or dismissals

3. ESCALATION SEQUENCES:
   - What's his typical escalation ladder?
   - How does he signal increasing pressure?
   - At what point does he back down vs. double down?

4. LEVERAGE TACTICS:
   - How does he connect unrelated issues for leverage?
   - Examples of linking separate negotiations or topics
   - What unrelated "chips" does he bring to discussions?

5. STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION PATTERNS:
   - Humor-as-threat phrases and veiled intimidation
   - Sarcasm and dark humor used strategically
   - Examples of "jokes" that weren't really jokes

Provide specific timeframes, behavioral examples, and characteristic phrases.
```

## **Step 6: Validation & Contradiction Analysis**

### Copy-Paste Prompt:
```
Review this comprehensive personality profile for [FIGURE NAME]:

[PASTE ALL PREVIOUS ANALYSES HERE - Steps 2A, 2B, 3, 4, 5]

Validation questions:
1. Do the contradictions between public and private behavior make strategic sense?
2. Which personality layer would dominate in different scenarios?
3. How would he balance public statements vs. private actions in:
   - High-stakes international negotiation
   - Domestic crisis situation
   - Military/security conflict
   - Economic pressure situation

4. Are there any inconsistencies or missing elements in the profile?
5. What scenarios would be most predictive of his behavior?

Identify and explain the key gaps between stated vs. revealed personality traits.

## **Step 7: Final Synthesis & Agent Profile Creation**

### Copy-Paste Prompt:
```
Create comprehensive dual-layer personality profile for AI agent implementation:

[PASTE ALL PREVIOUS ANALYSES - Steps 2A through 6]

Synthesize into structured profile:

PUBLIC OCEAN SCORES (1-10):
- Openness: X.X (what he claims/projects)
- Conscientiousness: X.X
- Extraversion: X.X
- Agreeableness: X.X
- Neuroticism: X.X

BEHAVIORAL OCEAN SCORES (1-10):
- Openness: X.X (what he actually demonstrates)
- Conscientiousness: X.X
- Extraversion: X.X
- Agreeableness: X.X
- Neuroticism: X.X

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Crisis_latency: X-Y hours typical silence window
- Scapegoat_probability: X% chance of blame deflection after setbacks
- Escalation_ladder: [step 1 → step 2 → step 3...]
- Humor_threat_phrases: [list of 10-15 characteristic threatening phrases]
- Follow_through_decay: X% commitment reliability over time
- Link_unrelated_issues: X% probability of bringing in tangential leverage

CONTRADICTION PATTERNS:
[Where public persona diverges from behavior]

CONTEXTUAL SWITCHING RULES:
[When does he use which personality layer?]

IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
How do these parameters modify responses in different scenarios?

PREDICTIVE FRAMEWORK:
How would each layer respond to specific negotiation/crisis situations?
```

**Save as:** `[name]_final_profile.json`

## **Usage Notes:**

- **Sequential Execution:** Run each prompt in order, building on previous responses
- **File Management:** Save each response with clear naming for easy reference
- **Validation:** Always include previous analyses in Steps 6 and 7
- **Adaptability:** Replace [FIGURE NAME] with any public figure
- **Implementation:** Final profile provides structured data for AI agent programming

This process creates sophisticated personality models capable of realistic strategic behavior and decision-making in simulated scenarios.
