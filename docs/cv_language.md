# AdversaryIQ - CV Language

## Final CV Bullet

**AdversaryIQ - Multi-Agent Crisis Simulator (Hackathon).** Scope: Solo-engineered 48-hour build at AI+ Expo D.C.; concept validated by OpenAI sponsor as aligned with their product roadmap. Technical Build: Architected multi-agent LLM platform simulating divergent crisis-response strategies via persona-driven agents (Roosevelt, Gandhi, Putin). Designed 7-stage psychological profiling pipeline (OCEAN scoring, escalation ladder, motif prompting) to drive agent decision logic. Shipped full-stack MVP: React frontend, Node.js/Express APIs (simulation, doc-analysis, voice-synthesis) with GPT-4o-mini orchestration and ElevenLabs TTS. Outcome: <200ms median latency across 10 stress-tested scenarios; recognized for commercial viability.

## Context

- **Event:** AI+ Expo Hackathon, Washington D.C.
- **Duration:** 48 hours
- **Track:** OpenAI
- **Team:** 2-person team (user did all engineering; teammate was non-technical)
- **Result:** Did not win track, but OpenAI sponsor indicated they are already implementing similar solution as business offering (strong validation)

## Key Changes from Original Bullet

| Original | Revised |
|----------|---------|
| "Lead Engineer" | "Solo-engineered" (stronger - you did all the code) |
| "lauded for business potential" | "validated by OpenAI as aligned with their product roadmap" (specific, credible) |
| Separate Hackathons section | Integrated into Projects with same format |
| Multiple bullets | Single structured bullet (Scope/Build/Outcome) |

## Interview Talking Points

### 1. What is AdversaryIQ?

"It's a multi-agent LLM platform that simulates how different world leaders would respond to crisis scenarios. Each agent has a distinct psychological profile - Roosevelt, Gandhi, Putin - and they respond differently based on their personality traits and decision-making patterns."

### 2. How does the psychological profiling work?

"I built a 7-stage pipeline: OCEAN personality scoring (Big Five traits), an escalation ladder that models how each persona responds to increasing pressure, and motif prompting that injects their historical decision-making patterns into the LLM context. This makes the agents behave consistently with their real-world counterparts."

### 3. Why these three personas?

"They represent fundamentally different approaches to conflict: Roosevelt's pragmatic interventionism, Gandhi's non-violent resistance, Putin's realpolitik. The contrast makes the simulation valuable for exploring different strategic outcomes."

### 4. What was the technical architecture?

"React frontend for the simulation interface, Node.js/Express backend with three API services: simulation orchestration, document analysis for scenario ingestion, and voice synthesis via ElevenLabs TTS. GPT-4o-mini handles the agent reasoning. The whole thing runs under 200ms median latency."

### 5. Why didn't you win?

"OpenAI told us they're already building something similar as a product offering. That's actually the best possible validation - we independently arrived at the same solution as their internal team in 48 hours."

### 6. What would you improve?

"Three things: (1) Add memory persistence so agents remember previous interactions across sessions, (2) Implement agent-to-agent debate mode where personas argue with each other, (3) Fine-tune smaller models on each persona's writing/speeches for faster inference."
